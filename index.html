  <h2>History and Legend</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  <p>Zen was kinapped as a young pup by a spirited and possibly intoxicated teen girl in rural Hermiston. Though the tiny chi-corgi-mutt missed her mama, and especially the ready access to <strong>milk</strong>, she grew to love her new family.</p>

  <p>Zen's teen mom grew up, became a massage therapist with a busy work schedule, and made the dificult decision to rehome her. Once again, Zen was separated from her mother, but being a resilient and brave little dog, she attached to her new people with fierce loyalty.</p>

  <p>Zen currently resides in Portland, OR. She is the CUTEST dog in the world.</p>
